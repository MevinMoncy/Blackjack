# Blackjack Game ♦️♠️♥️♣️

Welcome to the **Blackjack Game**! This is a simple text-based implementation of the classic casino card game Blackjack. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding that number.

## How to Play 🎲

1. Start the game by running the provided Python script using a Python interpreter. You can access the game through the following link: [Blackjack Game](https://replit.com/@mevinabraham/blackjack-final#main.py).

2. The game will display a welcome message and the initial hands of the player and the computer. The player will be dealt two cards, and one of the computer's cards will be visible.

3. The player's current hand score will be displayed. If the player's hand has an Ace (11 points), the game will automatically adjust its value to 1 point if the player's total score exceeds 21.

4. You'll be asked whether you want to get another card or pass. Type 'y' to draw another card or 'n' to pass. The goal is to build a hand as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.

5. After your turn, the computer will play its turn. The computer will keep drawing cards until its hand score is at least 17 points.

6. Once both players have completed their turns, the final hands and scores will be displayed, and the game's outcome will be determined.

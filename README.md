# Blackjack
This program implements a simplified version of the game Blackjack. The user can choose to play the game multiple times.

Upon starting a game, the program deals two cards each to the user and the computer (dealer). The user's cards are displayed along with the score, and the first card of the computer is shown.

The user is then prompted to either draw another card or pass. If the user chooses to draw a card, a new card is added to their hand. This process continues until the user decides to pass or their score exceeds 21, indicating they have gone bust.

After the user completes their turn, the computer starts drawing cards until its score reaches at least 17 or it goes bust.

Finally, the program displays the final hands and scores of both the user and the computer. It then determines the outcome of the game (win, lose, or draw) by comparing the scores.

The user is then given the option to play another round or exit the program.
